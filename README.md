# ArcheryEdge

An edge AI archery coaching system built on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. ArcheryEdge uses dual CSI cameras, real-time human pose estimation, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with a locally running LLM to deliver technique feedback — entirely on-device, no cloud required.

---

## Motivation

Archery technique coaching traditionally requires either an experienced coach present in person, or recording video and reviewing it manually after the fact. Neither approach provides real-time, objective, structured feedback that an athlete can act on immediately during a training session.

ArcheryEdge aims to bridge that gap by combining computer vision and on-device AI into a portable coaching assistant that:

- Captures and analyzes an archer's form in real time using stereo cameras
- Estimates full-body pose with sub-degree joint angle resolution
- Retrieves relevant coaching knowledge and delivers actionable feedback via a local LLM
- Runs entirely on the edge — no internet connection, no cloud latency, no data privacy concerns

## Pipeline Details

### 1. Camera Calibration

Stereo calibration is performed offline before deployment using a ChArUco board displayed on a screen (see [CameraCalibrationBoardAndroidApp](https://github.com/zebraoptics/CameraCalibrationBoardAndroidApp)):

- **Intrinsic calibration** — performed independently for each CSI camera (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients)
- **Stereo extrinsic calibration** — estimates the rotation and translation between the two cameras
- Calibration data is saved and loaded at runtime for 3D reconstruction

### 2. Pose Estimation

- Each frame from both cameras is processed through MediaPipe, Yolo, HRNet or ViTPose to extract 2D body keypoints
- The **1€ filter** is applied per keypoint to smooth temporal jitter without introducing lag — critical for real-time feedback on fast movements like the draw and release
- Stereo triangulation reconstructs 3D joint positions from the calibrated camera pair

### 3. Knowledge Base & RAG Pipeline

The coaching knowledge base is built offline:

- Archery coaching content is sourced from YouTube instructional videos
- **Gemini API** transcribes and extracts structured coaching knowledge, chunked into JSON
- Chunks are embedded and indexed into **ChromaDB** as a local vector store

At inference time:

- Pose metrics (joint angles, alignment, timing) are computed from the 3D keypoints
- Relevant coaching knowledge is retrieved from ChromaDB based on the detected technique pattern
- **Qwen2.5-3B** runs locally on the Jetson to synthesize the retrieved context into natural language feedback
